                        <p>Switzerland is home to some of the most beautiful lakes in Europe, with crystal clear waters surrounded by 
                            breathtaking mountain scenery. Lake Geneva, Lake Zurich, and Lake Lucerne are just a few examples of the many 
                            lakes that offer a wide range of summer activities, from swimming and boating to relaxing on the shore. 
                            Switzerland is geographically divided among the Swiss Plateau, the Alps and the Jura; the Alps occupy the 
                            greater part of the territory, whereas most of the country's population of 9 million are concentrated on the 
                            plateau, which hosts the largest cities and economic centres, including Zürich, Geneva and Basel.</p>

                        <p>In Switzerland, the climate is moderately continental on the plateau, with cold, dull 
                            winters and warm summers, during which thunderstorms can break out in the afternoon.
                            The Canton of Ticino, located on the south-facing side, has a milder and sunnier climate,
                            though it is very rainy, with afternoon thunderstorms in summer and heavy rains in 
                            autumn.In the mountains, the climate becomes colder with increasing altitude, but in 
                            winter, they are located above the blanket of fog and low clouds that often covers the 
                            plateau, so they are also sunnier in this season.</p>

                        <p>Everyone knows the famous Albula Pass in the canton of Grisons. However, not the colored 
                            mountain lake located above the train station Preda, which lies at an altitude of over 
                            1900 meters. A beautiful circular hike that is not only beautiful in summer but also 
                            worth a top excursion in autumn. Because here you can find larches that turn gold money 
                            in autumn. <br>Beautiful and unique hike directly along the glacier. Did you know that the 
                            Aletsch glacier in the canton of Valais is the largest and longest glacier in the Alps? 
                            The length of the glacier is 23km, and it has a height of 900 meters of eternal ice. 
                            Unfortunately, the glacier melts every year by 50-80 meters, researchers predict that 
                            by the end of 2100 the whole glacier will have disappeared. That is, save this hike and 
                            watch it before the glacier is gone</p>

                        <p>Not many cities have managed to retain their historic features quite as successfully as 
                            Bern, the capital of Switzerland. The old town of Bern is a UNESCO World Heritage Site 
                            and thanks to its 6 kilometres of arcades - the locals refer to them as 'Lauben' - 
                            boasts on of the longest weather-sheltered shopping promenades in Europe.</p>
